    <p>This is KBase app for running Centrifuge, a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers. The system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (5.8 GB for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome) and classifies sequences at a very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes. Together these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers.</p>
    
    <p>Centrifuge takes either a metagenomic reads library or a reads set as input. Centrifuge uses one reference databases for classification for current implementation in KBase, which is downloaded from the <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/manual.shtml">Centrifuge webserver page</a> (last updated 12/06/2016).  The databases is
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Bacteria, Aarchaea, Viruses, Human</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
       
    <p> The output of Centrifuge is a report with three modes for analyzing taxonomic abundance. The Result Table lists the taxonomic name, taxonomy ID, rank, genome size, number of (unique) Reads, and abundance. The Dendrogram sorts the organism and higher order taxa present into a phylogenetic tree for viewing relationships between organisms within the sample. Finally, the Krona plot is an interactive visualization of the organismal content and relative abundance, allowing user to focus on abundance within specific clades and generate high quality graphical representations of abundance.
